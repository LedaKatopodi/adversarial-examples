# adversarial-examples

The purpose of this project is dual: Primarily, to build a CNN model to accurately classify input images from the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets; As an extension, to create adversarial examples that can trich the CNN into mis-classifying the input.

Adversarial examples are inputs to machine learning models that intentionally cause the model to make a mistake; in that sense they're like optical illusions for machines.
